# Churn-Modeling
Churn Analysis: Fundraising The data at hand is a part of the database of a fundraising organization. As always, before we can start the modeling phase, we need to create the basetable. In order to do this, the information of different tables has to be combined (see Appendix). The fundraising organization gave you a data dump as of 02/02/2007. They will use the model you create to score their customer base in terms of their churn probability. NOTE: All datasets attached are in the SAS data format (sas7bdat). You will need to figure out how to import this into pandas. 1. Divide your data into different time windows. For example: If you have data for 5 years, • Use the first 3 years to train models • validate on the 4th year and pick your best model • The 5th year’s data will be your hold-out sample for determining out-of-sample accuracy 2. Create the Basetable (for training models) • 1 observation per customer • Only include information present during training period • Churn should happen during validation period or later 3. Follow the instructions below 1) Subset the extrel dataset according to the appropriate timewindow and only select donors with a commitment. 2) Create the following independent variables : a. Frequency b. Recency c. Total and average donation per donor d. Pay type per customer à Create new variables that signify whether a donor ever used sendout, order, own initiative and unknown e. Preferred mailing language f. Dummy whether the donor made a complaint g. Dummy whether communication direction was ever incoming 3) Create your dependent variable [if relationship has ended, churn = 1] 4) Merge everything and indicate those rows that have a missing with a dummy 5) Impute missings, treat outliers 6) Create competing models 7) Asses the performance of your model Appendix: Description of the tables Extrel: All the donors of the organization Variable Description Extrelno Unique identifier of each donor Exrelactcd Activity code of the donor Extrelstdt Start date of the relationship Exreldaten End date of the relationship (Missing: not ended) Extrelty: Description of the activity Variable Description Exrelactcd Activity code of the donor Exrelactde Description of the activity Nameaddr: Sociodemographical information Variable Description Extrelno Unique identifier of each donor Name1title Title to address someone Postcode Postcode Languagecode Preferred mailing language Payhistory: Paymenthistory of each donor Variable Description Pid Unique identifier for each payment Pdate Date of payment Pamt Amount of payment Extrelno Unique identifier of each donor Paytypecd Paytype O Bank transfer D Permanent order E Own initiative X Unknown Status Status of payment OK Normal/Real payment CO Correction (internal) RF RF (Refund) RC Recall Communication: All possible communication between the donor and the organization Variable Description Contid Unique identifier for each contact Mediumcode Medium of the contact (CI is unknown) Mntopcode Main topic code of the contact Classcode Class of the contact Extrelno Unique identifier for each donor Contdirec Direction of the communication I Incoming P Outgoing Contdate Date of the contact Commediu: Description of medium type Variable Description Mediumcode Code of the mediumtype Mediumdesc Description Commaint: Description of the main topic code Variable Description Mntopcode Main topic code Mntopdesc Description Comclas: Description of the contact class Variable Description Clascode Code of contact class Clasdesc Description
